# NLP-Natural-Language-Processing
NLP applications using deep learning like text generation etc.

1-> Poetry Generation: Using a collection of Irish Poems, trained a deep learning model that generates similar poems.

3-> Writings like Shakespeare: using a collection of Sakeshpeare's sonnets, training a model that writes text like Shakespeare.

*Note : Graph needs to be taken care of yet and properly document the code.


2-> Next Word Prediction: using an aerospace guidelines data, trained a deep learning model that predicts next word to complete the sentence.


*Note : Preprocess the 50klines dataset or slice it down by more than 50% and redefine the model and reduce training time per epoch. Keep this Project on hold since training time cannot be reduced...Need a better system with a better GPU or if possible a TPU.
